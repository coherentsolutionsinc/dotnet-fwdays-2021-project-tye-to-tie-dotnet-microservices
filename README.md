# "Project Tye to Tie Micro-services"

This repository contains a set of solutions demonstrated at .NET fwdays'21 conference at 2021-08-07. 

These demo materials are focused on different features of [Project Tye](https://github.com/dotnet/tye) hereinafter references as `tye` for simplicity.

## Content

* **solution-1** - demonstrated how `tye` can be used to run, deploy & debug a solution of two microservices built from the source code.
* **solution-2** - demonstrated how `tye` can be used to run, deploy & debug solution of two microservices, when one service is built from C# source files and another one is built from `Dockerfile`.
* **solution-3** - demonstrates how `tye` can be used to run, deploy & debug three microservices spread across two Git repositories - one, built from C# sources in the first repository and two (one from C# sources and one from `Dockerfile`) in the second repository.
* **solution-4** - demonstrates how `tye` can be used to run a service backed up with image based `redis` storage.
